# Coding Quiz
## HW Assignment 4

# Layout 

I used a simple layout with minimal styling. I centered everything within the container div, and at the start of the game, only the title, instructions, and start button are visible.

# Starting the Quiz
Once the start button is clicked, the instructions will disappear. The first question of ten will show up, and in the top left corner, the counter will start ticking down from 90 seconds. In the top right corner, the score will appear, counting up by one for every correct answer. For every wrong answer, the timer will deduct an additional ten seconds.

# Finishing the Quiz

The quiz will finish once the timer runs out, or the last question is answered. Once that happens, a message with the total score will appear. Furthermore, there will be a box where one can input his/her initials to save into the local storage with the respective score. Finally, there is a restart button where one can restart the quiz, hoping to score higher. 

In the top left corner, there is a link to the high scores, where if clicked, will hide all elements and display a list of the names and corresponding scores.

# What I Learned

This was by far the hardest homework so far, and took me probably 10 times as long as the other homeworks combined. However, I am very proud of what I accomplished as I have come really far. There were multiple moments, even the very beginning when I was psuedo coding, where I thought to myself that this would be impossible. But after slowly implementing what we learned and using my resources, I was slowly able to make it come together, and am very proud of this finished product.
